## AI agents

key concepts:
- A vector database stores numerical representations (embeddings) of text or other data, created by machine learning models. It enables semantic search by identifying similar meanings in high-dimensional space.

- Multi-agent structures allow to separate memories between different sub-tasks, with two great benefits:
Each agent is more focused on its core task, thus more performant
Separating memories reduces the count of input tokens at each step, thus reducing latency and cost.
